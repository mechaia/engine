# Mechaia

An engine made to learn how Vulkan works,
as well as explore alternatives to the very common OO model of many other engines.

## Building

Requires Rust 1.85 toolchain, as this engine uses some nightly features
and hasn't been kept up to date.

```sh
export RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1
cargo b --release
```
