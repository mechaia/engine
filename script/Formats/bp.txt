== Program Binary ==

A minimal exchange format for executables.

It is designed to be easily converted to native code for systems with
native 32-bit integers.


- Format -

Starts with the 16-byte string "BITCODEPROGRAM\0\0".
Followed by 16-byte interface UUID.
Interpretation of interface UUID is interface-/implementation specific.

Follows a list of registers.
Each register entry is:
-  1 bit: 0 if user type, 1 if builtin type (ABI specific)
- 31 bits: maximum register value, inclusive
- 32 bits: register count
Minimum register value is always 0.

Finally a list of functions.
Each function is either a block or a switch.

A block starts with high bit 0 and instruction count.
Then instructions with 3 MSB operation bits and 29 bit argument:
- 0 CALL
- 1
- 2
- 3
- 4
- 5
- 6
- 7 JUMP
All blocks end with a JUMP instruction

A switch starts with high bit 1 and register index to use as condition,
default branch with function target,
then branches with constant to compare with and function targeta.
